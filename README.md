# HR Analytics Dashboard Project

This project was inspired by a tutorial on the Codebasics YouTube channel, where they demonstrated building an HR analytics dashboard in Power BI. 
However, I decided to customize the workflow to leverage my Python and MySQL skills.

# Customized Workflow

Utilized Python to read and transform the initial HR data from the Excel file. This provided flexibility in data manipulation and cleaning.
Database Design with MySQL

Designed a MySQL database to efficiently store and manage the HR data. This step was crucial for creating a scalable solution.
Data Loading into MySQL Database

Loaded the transformed data into the MySQL database, ensuring it was organized and easily accessible for analysis.
Connecting Power BI to MySQL

Established a connection between Power BI and the MySQL database. This allowed for seamless integration and real-time updates.
Creating the HR Analytics Dashboard

Leveraged Power BI to design a dynamic and visually appealing HR analytics dashboard. This step ensured that the insights were presented in an easily digestible format.
